A healthcare information system for purebred horse breeding studs.

Purebreds are unique, expensive, and sensitive. They require adequate integrated care from multidisciplinary teams to ensure horses receive the right food intake, training, medications, and beauty care to perform well in competitions and to be cared for during lactation and pregnancy for breeding.

I have been working at a purebred horse breeding farm since October 2023, gaining a deep understanding of the internal processes. I have been establishing connections with farm owners across the region, including in Israel and Palestine, and validating the idea.

Currently, after specializing in the nutrition part of horse care and understanding their dietary needs, I have begun developing an information system that streamlines meal planning for horses based on different conditions such as pregnancy, lactation, young horses (less than a year old), and horses participating in competitions and requiring training.
